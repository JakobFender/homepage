During my apprenticeship, I gained insights into IT and software development. From my second to fourth year, I was
involved in improving and troubleshooting the V‑ZUG E‑Commerce platform and developing various data exports. In my final
two years, I took on the responsibility of mentoring and training apprentices in web development.
