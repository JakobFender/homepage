As a Junior Web Developer at V‑ZUG AG, I gained extensive experience in web development using Java, Angular, and Python.
Working in a Scrum team, I effectively utilized Git, JIRA, and Confluence. With a strong background in MySQL, Spring
MVC, and 3rd Line Support, I contributed to enhancing the company’s web presence.
