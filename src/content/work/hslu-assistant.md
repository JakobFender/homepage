As an AI Research Assistant, I have worked on several applied research projects. I contributed to the automatic
transcription and summarization of medical consultations, developing the frontend and implementing LLM-based summary
generation.

Another project focused on pedestrian detection and tracking in a public square using drone footage. I also developed a
complete information-extraction pipeline for processing photos of pension certificates.

My current work continues my bachelor thesis, where I explore distillation of audio tokenizers for deployment on
hearable devices. In addition to research projects, I manage 13 GPU workstations and set up and maintain a small Slurm
cluster.
