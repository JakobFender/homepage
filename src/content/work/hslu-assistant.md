As an Assistant, I’ve had the pleasure of working on several exciting projects. I contributed to the Automatic
Transcription and Summarization of Doctor Consultations, handling the frontend and summary generation using an LLM.
Currently, I’m focused on making the system deployable on edge devices and making more efficient use of the hardware. In
another project I developed a complete information extraction pipeline for photos of pension certificates. In Addition
to working in these project I also manage 13 GPU workstations and have set up a small Slurm cluster.
